//NOTE - COMPARISON OPERATOR::: compares two values and is a symbol and returns a Boolean (trthy falsy) result. Examples: ==, ===, !=, !==, <, >, <=, >=
//NOTE - CONDITIONAL STATEMENT::: a conditional statement will check boolean values and will preform differently depending on what the results are from the boolean values (whether or not it is true or false)
//NOTE - ELSE STATEMENT::: Else statements will only preform if the condition of an IF statement preceding it was FALSE.
//NOTE - ELSE IF STATEMENT::: will preform if the preceding IF statement was false && if its own statement is === to true
//NOTE - LOGICAL OPERATOR::: these are symbols that can combine boolean expressions and yield boolean result. These symbols include &&, ||, OR !
//NOTE - SWITCH STATEMENT::: allows you to test a single variable (item) against multiple values that it could be. A switch statement is basically an alternative to IF statements.
//NOTE - NESTING::: this is where you can place one condition statement inside of another conditional statement. This is a lot more complex, and creates more options, possibilities
//NOTE - FALSY::: a value === false. Examples === false, null, undefined, 0, empty Strings.
//NOTE - TRUTHY::: a value === true. Examples === all objects EXCEPT ANYTHING THAT IS FALSE (FALSE, NULL, UNDEFINED 0, EMPTY STRINGS)
